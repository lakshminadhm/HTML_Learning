# Introduction TO HTML
## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It's not a programming language but a markup language that uses tags to define elements and structure content for web browsers.

### Key characteristics of HTML: 
 -  **HyperText:** Allows linking documents via hyperlinks.
 -  **Markup:** Annotates and organizes text for web browsers.
 -  **Language:** A defined set of rules and syntax for web content creation.

## Why Learn HTML?
HTML is essential for anyone interested in web development. Here are five key reasons to learn HTML:
 -  **Build Websites:** The foundational language for web development.
 -  **Customize Content:** Edit templates, emails, and webpages as per your needs.
 -  **Understand Web Structure:** Learn how the internet works and how web pages are built.
 -  **Employment Opportunities:** The web development job market is growing rapidly, with strong demand for HTML skills.
 -  **Beginner-Friendly**: HTML is straightforward and easy to learn, making it a great first step in coding.
 - 
## HTML Features
-   Easy to learn and use.
-   Platform-independent (works across devices and browsers).
-   Supports multimedia (images, videos, audio).
-   Enables hyperlinking between documents.
-   Forms the building blocks of web development.

## HTML Elements and Tags
HTML documents are structured using **elements** and **tags**:

-   **Tags**: Keywords enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<p>` for a paragraph).
-   **Elements**: Consist of the opening tag, content (optional), and closing tag. Example: `<h1>Heading</h1>`.
-   **Void Elements**: Elements without closing tags, like `<br>` or `<img>`.

Example of an element:
```html
<p>Hello</p>
```

## Basic Structure of an HTML Page
Every HTML page is built on a set of essential elements:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Specifies document type -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- Root element of the document -->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- Metadata specifying character encoding -->
    <title>My First Webpage</title> <!-- Title displayed on browser tab -->
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1> <!-- Main heading -->
    <p>This is my first paragraph!</p> <!-- A paragraph -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Advantages of HTML
-   Universally supported by all browsers.
-   Works seamlessly with CSS and JavaScript.
-   Great for creating static webpages.
-   Beginner-friendly and widely documented.

## Disadvantages of HTML
-   Cannot create dynamic web pages without additional technologies.
-   Requires large amounts of code for complex layouts.
-   Lacks robust security features.

## HTML History
HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 to structure and share documents on the web. Over the years, it evolved significantly:
-   **HTML 1.0 (1991)**: The first version, basic and limited.
-   **HTML 2.0 (1995)**: Introduced standardized web development.
-   **HTML5 (Present)**: The latest and most advanced version, supporting modern web technologies like multimedia, APIs, and semantic tags.

## Web Browsers
HTML files are not compiled like traditional programming languages. Instead, browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) interpret HTML and render content visually.
Example workflow:
1.  Save the HTML file with `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
2.  Open the file in a web browser to view the content.
